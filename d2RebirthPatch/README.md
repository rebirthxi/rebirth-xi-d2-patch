# Welcome to Rebirth D2!

Before I get started, **please read INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md** if you've never installed a D2 mod before. Otherwise...

This is a 1.13c D2 mod from the RebirthXI private server gaming community! This mod is built off of the amazing BaseMod
by Devurandom, and utilizing the fantastic work of Mir Drualga (Slash Diablo) and Bolrog (D2DX) for a smooth, higher
resolution D2 experience! It draws heavy inspiration from amazing mods like D2 Apocalpyse / Temple of Zakarum / Sebzy's
Realm and TalonRage's amazing Requiem of Sorrows mod.

Our personal touches include scaling difficulty in such a way where character should be able to max out their levels in
normal difficulty (in terms of level), and then have tons of fun and new interesting and extremely challenging content
in the Nightmare and Hell acts respectively!

The goal with this mod is to field a mod that feels very similar to vanilla Diablo (no new classes / class skills, etc),
but new builds and challenging areas that are added in addition to the classics!
